This website can guess a number from 1 to 1000000 within 20 guesses. This is because it elimanates half of the remaining choices each guess once it knows if the guess was too high or too low. This means the maximum amount of guesses it will take to find your number is equal to log base 2 of 1,000,000 which is 19.93 (This rounds to twents because you cannot have .93 of a guess).
